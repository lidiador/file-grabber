This is a simple Web crawler in Python 3, that logs into a website and downloads files from all the links it can find.
It is also the very first piece of code that I was paid for. :)
Some of the solutions can certainly be improved upon, I used them because the repository I was supposed to scrape and the website itself
were very messy. Also, bear in mind that I am still learning my way around. Most of the code should be straightforward, please see
the comments for some explanations.
