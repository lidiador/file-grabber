This is a simple Web crawler in Python 3, that logs into a website and downloads files from all the links it can find. 
It is also the very first piece of code that I was paid for (of course, I made it more generic here). 
Some of the solutions can certainly be improved upon, 
I used them because the repository I was supposed to scrape and the website itself were very messy. 
Also, bear in mind that I am still learning my way around. 
Most of the code should be straightforward, please see the comments in the code for some explanations.
